# React.js_HelloWorld

My first dive into React.js!

# How to run

1. On Terminal, set `cd` to be the project's working directory.
2. Install the required packages in the root of the working directory (list below).
3. Clone the working directory folder structure and files into your machine.
4. On Terminal, run: `npm run start`.
5. Browser will open with React app (with hot reloading!).
6. To terminate, Control+C on Terminal.

Note: TypeScript module components are found in the `src/components` folder. Everything else in the working directory is scaffolding so that the browser can interpret and render content, such as that found in `App.tsx`.
